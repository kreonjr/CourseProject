# Frontend Building and Deploying

This project is using React for the frontend and the website is hosted on [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/). No further changes should be needed even if the data source changes. It is setup to dynamically listen to changes on the Firebase Real-Time Database instance setup for this project.

## Available Scripts

If you would like to work on local development, in the same directory as this **README**, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

## Deployment

To deploy changes to the website UI itself, please contact [Creon Creonopoulos](mailto:creonc2@illinois.edu) for access to the [firebase console](https://console.firebase.google.com/) tied to this project.
